## 🎨 Design Principles

### Component Design
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has a clear, focused purpose
- **Reusability**: Components are designed to be reused across the application
- **Props Interface**: Clean and well-defined prop interfaces

### Styling Approach
- **Utility-First**: Leveraging Tailwind CSS for rapid development
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive breakpoints
- **Consistent Theme**: Unified color scheme and spacing throughout

### State Management
- **Local State**: Using React hooks for component-specific state
- **Data Flow**: Unidirectional data flow following React patterns
- **Side Effects**: Proper handling of localStorage operations

## 🔧 Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Runs the app in development mode
- `npm test` - Launches the test runner
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production
- `npm run eject` - Ejects from Create React App (one-way operation)

## 📱 Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive and optimized for:
- **Desktop**: Full-width layout with 4-column statistics grid
- **Tablet**: 2-column statistics grid with adapted spacing
- **Mobile**: Single-column layout with touch-friendly controls
